<div class="statement">
<p>This piece depicts our multi-faceted personalities -- we each have a darker side that we donâ€™t show, and we wear various masks depending on the context. I chose to show different fragments fading in and out, along with text and other images to create a constantly moving and changing face, giving a sense of changing identity and internal conflict. I wanted the sound to add to the feeling of disquiet. I recorded sounds on a violin and tracks of whispering, reading short poems by my grandmother and others that appear briefly in the animation. I then compressed, cut, and added some effects, layering the sounds together to simulate a crowd of whispering voices, none of them distinct enough to discern individually.
