	<div class="statement"><p>Inspiration for this piece originally came from a film titled <i>Ingrid Goes West</i>, in which a woman becomes obsessed with an Instagram personality. I began to think about the difference between our real lives and that which we portray to others and the split in identity that this can cause. I started with several different pictures of my own face -- a painted self-portrait as well as photos -- and incorporated images of other faces, sculpted and painted, sliced and jumbled beneath the image of a broken mirror. I then incorporated text from a previous art project in which I asked strangers to anonymously write secrets on note cards, as well as poetry found in a street in Italy. Combined, they form a face fractured, overlapping with various conflicting messages. </p></div>
